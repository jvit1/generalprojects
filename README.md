### Welcome!
This repository will hold all small projects. This is soley a portfolio repository to showcase
skills that do not require their own repository.

I'd recommend viewing the PDF's in the respository (if avaliable) to easily see comments and my thought process as I'm working through these problems.


### Descriptions of projects:
1) *Titanic* - The traditional predictive analytics project. Do passengers survive or die? Data were found on Kaggle and entered into the ongoing competition for scoring.
